# README


Concerns:
1. Email - has to take in lowercase into database.
2. Unable to link to users/:user_id.
3. Query for displaying related wall posts.
4. If contents are entered with no space, it will float out of the box. 
5. Should track which users are posting what content. 


Notes: 
1. Users can target Users database and image.
2. CFB icon now links to root.
3. Root will render sign up form when not in session.
4. Root will render scroll bar when in session. 
5. session[:user_id] is targetable.

Idea:
1. Add more details to users and sign up.
